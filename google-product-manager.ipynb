    "## Goal\n",
    "The goal of this Jupyter notebook is to mine the information from Google's issue tracker to produce two prioritized list of features and issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "The following is the strategy of attaining the above goal:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mine google's public issue tracker for raw data for each issue and feature.\n",
    "2. Divide the work into features and issues (the next steps are repeated for each).\n",
    "3. Use some kind of natural language toolkit to identify common terms and bigrams.\n",
    "4. Use a machine learning unsupervised clustering algorithm to identify clusters of issues and features.\n",
    "5. Perform a brief case study on the top 5 clusters.\n",
    "6. Identify the scenario (W5H) for each cluster.\n",
    "7. Identify the persona for each cluster.\n",
    "8. Identify stories for each cluster.\n",
    "9. Priorize the stories.\n",

    "Google's issue tracker is public.  It allows anyone to report issues and request features.  The issue tracker does not have a supported API or SDK (that I can tell), but when loading the pages with developer mode enabled I can find a request that returns a JSON structure with the details necessary to do some kind of post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the issue tracker in development mode, we can see that a XHR request is made using the following URL:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bugs: https://issuetracker.google.com/action/issues?count=25&p=1&q=status:open+type:bug&s=created_time:desc\n",

    "\n",
    "I did some research and noticed the following caveats:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The response is multi-line and the first line is not valid json.\n",
    "* The HTTP request requires authentication and there is no official API or SDK for the issue tracker.\n",
    "* The syntax required the character \"+\" which the python requests library encodes by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "First I used a browsercookie library in python to bypass the authentication piece (I tried using APIs, but had difficulty)."

      "I recently read about these Changes:https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/577303https://android-review.googlesource.com/c/platform/system/sepolicy/+/588493and oppose them, as they will basically impose the same restrictions as an iPhone.The reason: There seem to be no way for the user to indicate that background recording/filming should be allowed. There should be an per-app permission setting, where the user can change this.Why I Think a user-changeable setting should be available:For camera:Some lockscreens have the ability to take the photo of the user at attempts of entering the incorrect password, and then email this photo to the phone owner.Since such apps will Always be at the background while the phone is locked, I Think there should be a possibility for the user to indicate that he/her want to allow the app to record video/take photos while idle.For mic:The mic change is a bit more aggressive. This change will basically make most call recorders useless, as the call recorder would of course be at the background while the phone dial screen is at front.And the most useful feature of call recording is just to record for example telemarketers because some countries places the burden of proving theres no contract, on the individual (provided there is a minimal evidence for the contract - for example a record showing that the individual talked to the telemarketer), rather than placing the burden to prove there is a contract, on the telemarketer firm. This makes it easy to bill users that are careless to talk to a telemarketer even if they don't agree to the contract.Yes, I know its possible to put the dial screen in the background and the call recorder in front, but that would make it impossible to enter DTMF which many telemarketing system requires.Of course, there is countries which require acceptance of all parties in a call Before call recording may take Place - but its the responsibility of the end user to follow local laws. It shouldn't be google that forces their laws on users living in countries where these laws is not present.Another thing where \"secret\" recording may be useful, is in situations where you want to record something without the other party knowing. For example a meeting.Ability to have a background app (that yourself installed, yourself is running and is not spying on you) that listen on the mic while \"hidden\" that can record this, is good aswell.Another suggestion that may make this possible without extra permissions:That is to have it so IF any recording or filmning is taking Place for an idle app, the system will then show a permanent non-dismissable notification that will tell the user that recording/filmning is taking Place.When the recording or filmning has ended, the notification should stay, but become dismissable. The text could change to that \"The app X did film/record for Y seconds/minutes/hours ago\".This will atleast alert the user that an app is spying on the user. Instead of disabling it completely for users.\n"
